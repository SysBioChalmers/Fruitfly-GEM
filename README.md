> Introduction (please delete after reading):  
[standard-GEM](https://github.com/MetabolicAtlas/standard-GEM) is a template repository that aims to standardize the format of genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) versioned with git. In addition to encouraging the open-sourcing of GEMs, it facilitates the import of GEMs into databases and online websites. Moreover, it provides the community with a familiar structure that is easy to adopt through this repository itself. The template comes with a set of requirements and recommendations, packaged as to-do items in a hidden Markdown file in this repository `.standard-GEM.md`. After downloading this repository, or using it as a template, those to-do items provide guidance to how adherence to the standard can be obtained.

> Instructions for this `README` (please delete after reading):  
This is the `README.md` template provided by [standard-GEM](https://github.com/MetabolicAtlas/standard-GEM) and was crafted to cover most use-cases.  
Feel free to edit this template `README`. Blanks are indicated by `{{ test }}`. One may use a search function to find these `{{`. Here are some examples of blanks used throughout this file: `{{organization or username}}` is the organization name or username for this GitHub repository, eg. `SysBioChalmers`; `{{repository name}}` is the name of this GitHub repository, eg. `yeast-GEM`.  
If you find this template does not fit your needs, we would appreciate if you could report this by creating a new issue on [standard-GEM](https://github.com/MetabolicAtlas/standard-GEM/issues).
